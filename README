To install, follow the instructions in INSTALL...

The GIMP-Interface:

If you're all set up, you should find the plug-ins in Filters/Sound.
"SendOSC" is the gui version, which also stores preferences.
"SendOSC (without GUI)" just calls SendOSC with the last 
parameters.

You can set keyboard shortcuts for them in GIMP in 
"Edit/Keyboard Shortcuts" - this is probably the best way to use it.

SuperCollider:

Then just open gimposc.scd in SuperCollider and follow the instructions.
If you get a message about a received array, you are probably set up...

Place the python files in your GIMP plug-in folder, e. g.
      ~/gimp-2.6/plug-ins

Needs SimpleOSC from
      http://www.ixi-audio.net/content/body_backyard_python.html
installed. Just follow the instructions in the Package.

Perhaps you have to place the "osc"-folder where you copied the python
files to make it work.
